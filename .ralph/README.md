# Ralph Wiggum Loop

This directory contains files generated by the `ralph.sh` development loop.

## Files

- `progress.md` - Tracks the current state of the development loop
- `ralph.log` - Detailed log of all loop iterations

## How It Works

The Ralph Wiggum loop is an iterative development methodology where:

1. **Context is provided** - The AI agent receives the PRD (JSON format), current progress, and sprint plan
2. **Work is performed** - The agent implements tasks from the PRD
3. **Verification runs** - Tests, linting, type checking, and builds are executed
4. **Progress is tracked** - Changes are committed and progress is updated
5. **Loop continues** - The process repeats until completion criteria are met

## PRD Format

The PRD is stored as `PRD.json` in the project root. It uses a structured JSON format for easy parsing and programmatic access. The script will validate JSON syntax if `jq` is available.

## Completion

The loop completes when:
- The completion token `[RALPH_COMPLETE]` appears in `progress.md`
- Maximum iterations are reached (default: 50)
- Manual interruption (Ctrl+C)

## Usage

```bash
# Run the loop
./ralph.sh

# Set custom max iterations
MAX_ITERATIONS=100 ./ralph.sh
```

## Progress Tracking

The `progress.md` file is updated after each iteration with:
- Current iteration number
- Completed tasks (from git commits)
- Current focus area
- Blockers and notes

## Verification

The loop automatically runs:
- `npm run lint` (if available)
- `npm run type-check` (if available)
- `npm test` (if available)
- `npm run build` (if available)

All checks are non-blocking - warnings are logged but don't stop the loop.
