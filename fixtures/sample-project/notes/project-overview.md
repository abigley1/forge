# Project Overview

This project is building a small CNC router for PCB milling and light aluminum work.

## Goals

1. Mill PCBs with 0.1mm precision
2. Cut aluminum up to 3mm thick
3. Total build cost under $500
4. Footprint under 24" x 24"

## Key Decisions

- [[motor-selection]] - Choosing drive motors (in progress)
- [[enclosure-material]] - Frame material (decided: aluminum extrusion)

## Current Tasks

- [[design-frame]] - Frame CAD design (in progress)
- [[order-parts]] - Procurement (blocked)

## Components

- [[nema17-stepper]] - Candidate motor
- [[aluminum-extrusion]] - Selected frame material

## Research

- [[motor-research]] - Motor comparison research

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|
| Frame design complete | Jan 25 |
| Parts ordered | Jan 30 |
| Frame assembled | Feb 15 |
| First motion | Mar 1 |

## Budget

- Frame: $150
- Motors: $100
- Electronics: $150
- Spindle: $80
- Misc: $20
- **Total: $500**
